#Product Engineering - Mike Lee @bwf

* starts with an idea + product engineering =  profit (underwear gnome algorithm)

**Three Traits**

1. Over-arching
2. Top-Down
3. Empathetic: have to put yourself into position of the user; see the earth from the sun's perspective


##Complete History of Machinery

**Trends:**

* Hardware trends
* Software trends: configurablility!

"Product is formed at intersection technology and liberal arts"

Technology = "new stuff"
    
    tekhno "art skill craft" + logia "theory, science"

##Understanding People

* "In reality, people are not lazy, but it helps to pretend they are" - not going to go out of the
* "In reality, peole are not stupid…"
* "Or impatient…"
* "People are not ignorant and apathetic, but they don't know and don't care"
    
##Sharpen Focus

"Think it through" - cut it down to the simplest implementation of the idea = Engineering Elegance

* Great products are 80% boring and 20% crazy - one sentence to sum up a product

* Originality is not as important as quality - produce something that resignates with people

"Its like _______, but with _______" - people are in love with their own ideas, and don't see their flaws

##Find your Product

"What problem are you trying to solve?" - break it down to the very essence
"Why is that better?"

"Computers that are made for computers, not for people" 

"We like computers better than people"


##Consider Your Customers

"Start at the end by making a commercial" - know what your building: put yourself in your customer's shoes


##Pick Your Platform

* Concentrate on the platform you like, something you can resignate with.

**Platform is culture** - different people, different users


##Building a Team

* Multi-Platform: ```n platforms, n+1 teams```


##Delivering Your Product

* Test your product like it was made by your archnemesis

* "Build the product your test user expects" - Intuitive Software

* "Real Artists Ship" - Shipping is a necessity, not an excuse.  Shipping the rough draft is an amateur mistake.

* "Cut Features, not quality"

"Fear Social Debt as much or more than Technical Debt", you can go back and fix technical debt, (although you probably wont)


##When Is It Ready?

**El Mariachi** AKA **"HOLY CRAP!"

**The Hook**
