##HTML5 Goodness
 <!DOCTYPE HTML> - how simple is that?


##Objects/Common Markup

* section
* nav - navigate around page, navigation block
* article - post, blog entry, etc. reusable and distributable
* aside - tangential content, not main content
* hgroup - group headers
* header - doesn't actually create a new 'section' <header></header>
* footer - doesn't actually create a new 'section' <footer></footer>
* time - encode time/date for machine use (calendar events); flexible; doesn't have to match datetime attribute; pubdate is attribute to identify its a publication  <time datetime="2011-02-22" pubdate>February 22, 2011</time>
* mark - highlight; calls attention to something
